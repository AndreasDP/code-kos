# Problem Statement

It is our goal and responsibility as Software Developers to write high quality code that is maintainable, efficient, and easy to understand.
But this is not always the case. You might be pressured for time, might not be aware of best practices, or simply might not have the experience yet.
This then leads to wasted time and effort in the long run, as other developers (or even yourself) have to spend extra time reviewing Pull Requests.

Sometimes Pull Requests are not reviewed properly, and bad code gets merged into the main branch, leading to technical debt and potential bugs.
And even if the provided code is good, it might not follow the same coding style as the rest of the codebase, leading to inconsistencies and confusion.

Specific problems that I have identified in my own experience:
- Inconsistent coding styles
- Naming conventions not followed
- Lack of best practices
- Poorly written or unclear code
- Lack of documentation or comments
- Performance issues
- Missing tests or inadequate test coverage

### Alternatives / Existing Solutions
This is not a new problem, and there are many existing solutions that address this issue.
But most of them are paid solutions, and might not fit our specific needs.

There are several existing tools that does exactly this, but most of them are paid solutions.
It would be ideal if we can build something in-house that is free to use, using as much open-source software as possible.


# Research

To further understand the problem, I gathered some data various project managers and developers.

I asked them the following questions:
- What are the most common issues you see in Pull Requests?
- How do you currently review Pull Requests (Manual vs Automated)?
- How much time do you spend reviewing Pull Requests?
- Do you look for specific things when reviewing Pull Requests? Or do you just look for general code quality?
- How do you feel when you have to review a Pull Request that is of poor quality? 

Follow-up questions:
- PR template questions (quick survey)
- File/line count impact (follow-up)
- Ticket/user story understanding (follow-up)
- Author-specific review differences (follow-up)
