This is a scratch pad for ideas and notes

The project should be configurable to allow users to customize the rules and checks according to their specific needs and preferences.
For now, this will be specific to JavasScript and Apex codebases.

Technologies to use:
- Node.js Scripts
- Shell Scripts
- AWS CodeBuild

## Technology Usage Area

### AWS CodeBuild
We already use AWS CodeBuild for our CI/CD pipeline using Infrastructure as Code.
We already run numerous Node.js scripts, so we can add additional scripts to check for code quality.

### Node.JS Scripts
Write scripts to:
- Check for coding style consistency (Prettier) - Done
- Check for best practices (ESLint)
-

### Shell Scripts
Write scripts to:
- TODO (more complex scenarios)
