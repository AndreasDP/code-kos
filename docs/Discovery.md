# Problem Space Exploration

## Introduction
Code quality has always been an important to me. I don't know if it's a sign of perfectionism or a little ADHD, but I do know that one should take pride in their work.
I'm not saying my code is always perfect, in fact, I cringe when looking back at my code from 3 years ago. But that is also a sign of growth.
So with all the tools that's available for us today, how can we assure we provide top-tier code quality to clients?

## Core Problem
I've noticed from personal experience, working alongside other developers, that code differs significantly, and so does quality. What can we do to better align quality?
Software development teams struggle with maintaining consistent code quality across their codebase, leading to technical debt, bugs, and reduced productivity.
So let's unpack this and see if we can define the problem a little better.

## Problem Dimensions
I've done some research on code quality, and listed key points in code quality below:

### 1. **Code Quality Issues**
- Inconsistent coding styles and conventions (readability)
- Poor naming conventions
- Lack of best practices implementation
- Unclear or poorly written code
- Missing or inadequate documentation
- Performance issues
- Insufficient test coverage

### 2. **Process Problems**
- Inconsistent review processes
- Lack of clear quality standards
- No automated quality checks
- Manual review bottlenecks
- Inadequate feedback loops

### 3. **Knowledge & Skills Gaps**
- Developers unaware of best practices
- Inconsistent mentoring and knowledge sharing
- Lack of coding standards documentation
- No systematic approach to quality improvement

### 4. **Organizational Challenges**
- Time pressure leading to shortcuts
- Lack of quality metrics and tracking
- No clear ownership of code quality
- Inadequate tooling and automation

### 5. **Impact Areas**
- **Development Velocity**: Slower feature delivery due to bugs and rework
- **Maintenance Burden**: Increased time spent fixing issues
- **Team Morale**: Frustration with poor code quality
- **Technical Debt**: Accumulating problems over time
- **Business Impact**: Delays, bugs affecting users, increased costs

### Alternatives / Existing Solutions
This is not a new problem, and there are many existing solutions that address this issue.
But most of them are paid solutions, and might not fit our specific needs.

There are several existing tools that does exactly this, but most of them are paid solutions.
It would be ideal if we can build something in-house that is free to use, using as much open-source software as possible.


# Data Collection

## Research Questions (Broader Problem Space)

In order to better understand the problem from other key-players (stakeholders), I've constructed a list of questions for data analysis.

### Core Questions
1. **What role do you play in your project? (Project Manager, Tech Lead, QA, Developer, Business Analysis, Designer, etc)**
2. **What are the biggest challenges you face with code quality in your team/project?**
3. **How do you currently ensure code quality? (Processes, tools, reviews)**
4. **What happens when code quality is poor? (Impact on team, project, users)**
5. **What would help you improve code quality? (Tools, processes, training)**
6. **How do you measure or track code quality currently?**

### Follow-up Questions
- What tools do you use for code quality? (ESLint, SonarQube, etc.)
- How much time do you spend on code reviews vs. writing new code?
- What causes poor code quality in your experience? (Time pressure, lack of knowledge, etc.)
- How do different team members approach code quality?
- What would success look like for code quality in your team?

### Reason for these 6 questions:
- Role → Sets context
- Challenges → Core problem understanding
- Current methods → Process mapping
- Impact → Pain point validation
- Solutions → Opportunity identification
- Metrics → Success criteria

## Research Findings
TODO: Summarize the findings from the research phase and highlight any interesting insights or patterns.

# WIP: Trends Analysis Framework

## Analysis Categories
To digest the data received from stakeholders, the following points can be used.

### 1. **Problem Patterns**
- Most common code quality issues
- Root causes of poor quality
- Impact severity and frequency
- Team-specific challenges

### 2. **Process Patterns**
- Current quality assurance methods
- Review process effectiveness
- Tool usage and satisfaction
- Automation gaps

### 3. **Stakeholder Patterns**
- Different perspectives by role
- Common pain points across roles
- Varying priorities and concerns
- Communication and feedback patterns

### 4. **Solution Patterns**
- Desired improvements
- Tool preferences and requirements
- Process changes needed
- Success criteria and metrics

## Analysis Questions
- What are the top 3 most mentioned problems?
- Which stakeholders have the most/least pain?
- What solutions are most/least desired?
- What patterns emerge across different teams/roles?
- What are the biggest gaps between current state and desired state?

# WIP: Stakeholder Mapping
To identify the stakeholders (people who are affected by code quality), I've identified a couple of key-players to
further define the problem a little better:

## Primary Stakeholders
- **Developers (Junior/Senior)**: Write code, review PRs, maintain codebase
- **Tech Leads/Architects**: Set standards, make architectural decisions
- **Project Managers**: Track delivery, manage technical debt
- **QA Engineers**: Test code, find bugs, ensure quality
- **DevOps Engineers**: Deploy code, maintain CI/CD pipelines
- **Product Managers**: Define requirements, prioritize features

## Secondary Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Experience the impact of code quality through bugs/performance
- **Support Teams**: Deal with issues caused by poor code quality
- **Business Stakeholders**: Feel the cost of technical debt and delays

## Stakeholder Pain Points
- **Developers**: Time spent on reviews, fixing bugs, understanding legacy code
- **Tech Leads**: Inconsistent code quality, technical debt accumulation
- **PMs**: Delays due to bugs, difficulty estimating work
- **QA**: More bugs to find, unclear requirements in code
- **DevOps**: Deployment issues, infrastructure problems from poor code
- **Product**: Features delayed due to technical issues
